**Getting Started with the Model Code**
Welcome to our project repository! This guide will help you set up and run the models we've developed.

**Prerequisites:**
Before you start, make sure to install all the necessary libraries and dependencies. Run the following command to install them:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Training the Model:**
To train the model, you'll need to specify the dataset you want to use directly in the `train.py` script.

1. Navigate to the `train.py` file.
2. Open the file and locate the "Select dataset" section.
3. Set the `DATASET_NAME` variable to your desired dataset. Available options include:
   - "FashionMNIST"
   - "EMNIST"
   - "CIFAR10"
   - "CIFAR100"
   - "SVHN"

Example:
DATASET_NAME = "FashionMNIST"

4. Save the changes and close the file.

To start training, run:
python train.py


**Using the Jupyter Notebook:**
If you prefer using a notebook, refer to the Jupyter notebook attached with this submission. 
It provides detailed steps for training the model on the FashionMNIST dataset and can be adapted for other datasets by changing the dataset variable as described above.


**Code Availability:**
All code and additional documentation are available on our GitHub repository. Visit https://github.com/fouad-khattari/CapsResNet to access and download the code.
